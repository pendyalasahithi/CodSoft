            "I'm a versatile web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for crafting responsive and dynamic user interfaces, as well as Python and Java for robust backend development. I'm proficient in working with databases like MongoDB and SQL, which allows me to design and manage complex data-driven applications.
            
            <br>In my recent projects, I developed an Interactive Quiz App that challenges users with engaging quizzes and provides instant feedback. Additionally, I built a Weather Dashboard that delivers real-time weather updates using JavaScript and API integration. These projects showcase my ability to combine functionality with a seamless user experience.
